Without regular shipments of food, the British Isles would starve. They needed a new strategy.

Surprisingly, the strategy didn't come from the sailors engaged in the day-to-day of combat with German U-boats—it came from eight women from the Women's Royal Navy Service. With the help of former ship captain Gilbert Roberts, who trained them on the practical capabilities of the ships and submarines, they ran wargames that revealed the British seriously misunderstood German tactics: they had assumed the U-boats would attack from outside the shipping convoy; in actuality they waited for the convoy to pass over them, and attacked from the stern.

The women—nicknamed the Wrens—developed new strategies for fighting the submarines, overcoming skepticism when 18-year-old Janet Okell five times defeated a British admiral in submarine wargames. The tactics they developed were extremely successful, and they trained over 5,000 officers throughout the course of the war.

Their success highlights how a small and highly capable team working on the effectiveness of a larger organization can unlock powerful new potentials, leading to an outsized impact. At Mercury, our Developer User Experience (DUX) Teams fill the role of enablers, via education, tooling, and frameworks that support those building the product. Mercury is hiring an Engineering Manager to lead our Backend Developer User Experience team.

As the Senior Engineering Manager for Backend DUX, you'll lead a team of incredibly talented engineers in creating a developer ecosystem which delivers speed, quality, and enjoyment for Mercury's 200+ engineers. Mercury's primary backend language is Haskell, and your team is comprised of industry recognized thought leaders in that community. You'll report to the Director of Stability, Infrastructure, and Developer UX, work alongside other platform teams whose overarching mission is to achieve startup-like developer effectiveness at scale.

In this role, you'll be responsible for:
• Instrumenting the SDLC, ensuring we have effective quantitative and qualitative ways of understanding our engineers’ speed, quality, and enjoyment of their work.
• Adopting and evangelizing a product-centric approach to improving the effectiveness of our backend engineers through the introducing of novel tools and methodologies.
• Guiding the organization through adoption of solutions, and championing their integration across Mercury’s broader engineering team, and graceful sunsetting of legacy solutions we wish to move past.
• Cultivating a trusting, psychologically safe, and challenging culture on your team.
• Working with other Infrastructure, Stability, and Developer Experience leaders, Product Management, and other stakeholder teams on setting the long term vision for and defining what the software development journey looks like at Mercury.

And here are some traits we think would be helpful for the job:
• You possess a passion for enabling other engineers, and you feel a great sense of reward as your team’s investments improve engineering velocity and enjoyment. You’re always eager to challenge your own and your team’s assumptions, creating data-backed cases for investments and strategic shifts.
• You’re receptive towards both positive and critical feedback from users, ensuring customer insights drive our decisions as we find new ways to improve engineering speed of iteration and overall experience.
• You enjoy navigating and owning ambiguous problem domains, and have a set of tools that have served you well in creating a strategy and effectively communicating your plan to others to get buy-in and create alignment.
• You’re comfortable getting your hands dirty as a developer, and are familiar with the experience of using a suite of modern supportive tools as well as the pain and frustration when developer friction impedes your progress.

The person who will be best setup for success will have the following experience:
• You have previous experience managing a developer tooling and/or building products for developers
• You have 4+ years managing software engineering teams (experience leading remote-first distributed teams is a plus)
• You have 3+ years experience as a software engineer (Haskell/functional language experience a plus)

The total rewards package at Mercury includes base salary, equity, and benefits.

Our salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry. New hire offers are made based on a candidate’s experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.

We’re not just running pipelines. We’re building systems that think like scientists. As a **Senior Bioinformatician** at Mithrl, you’ll play a critical role in shaping how our AI platform understands and interprets complex genomics data—across bulk RNA\\-seq, single\\-cell, CRISPR, and beyond.


You won’t just run tools, you’ll know how they work. You’ll help us design smarter algorithms, build analysis frameworks that generalize, and uncover insights that matter to drug discovery teams around the world. You’ll work closely with our AI scientists, software engineers, and customer partners to bridge data, computation, and biology in real time.

**What You’ll Do**
------------------

* **Ownership**: Own the full bioinformatics stack \\- from ingesting raw data to generating insights that drive real\\-world drug program decisions. Your work will be the scientific backbone of Mithrl’s AI.

* Validate findings, spot inconsistencies, and suggest new hypotheses for customers and internal use
* Translate messy biological questions into clean computational problems, and vice versa
* Mentor junior scientists and review technical outputs to ensure scientific accuracy
* Stay up\\-to\\-date on the latest methods in transcriptomics, functional genomics, and statistical analysis

**What We’re Looking For**
--------------------------

* 5–10 years of experience in bioinformatics
* Deep fluency in **Python** and **SQL**, including experience working directly with structured genomics data at scale
* Strong grasp of statistical and machine learning methods applied to high\\-throughput biological data
* Hands\\-on experience with modern genomics tools and file formats (e.g., GWAS, aligners, etc.)
* Ability to interpret and debug pipeline results; **not just run them**
* Strong scientific judgment, clarity in communication, and attention to detail
* ***\\*\\*Curiosity, persistence, and a drive to understand how things work***
* ***\\*\\*High energy, strong work ethic, and a track record of getting things done***
* ***\\*\\*Discipline Wins: At Mithrl, the social currency is hard work and consistency. The problems we’re solving are complex and take time to bear fruit. We value teammates who show up every day, work with focus, and bring long\\-term discipline to their craft***
* Bonus: Experience working with AI/ML scientists or integrating bioinformatics with production software

**What You’ll Love**
--------------------

* **Scope:** Shape how a cutting\\-edge AI platform thinks about biology and delivers real insight
* **Impact:** Your work will directly influence drug discovery decisions at top biotech companies
* **Team:** Join a world\\-class crew of AI scientists, engineers, and biologists working together at full speed
* **Culture:** No ego, no bureaucracy. Just deep thinking, fast execution, and high ownership
* **Location:** Beautiful SF office with a focus on in\\-person, high\\-bandwidth collaboration
* **Benefits:** Comprehensive PPO health coverage through Anthem (medical, dental, and vision) \\+ 401(k) with top\\-tier plans
